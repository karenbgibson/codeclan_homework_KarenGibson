```{r}

library(tidyverse)

revenue_breakdown <- CodeClanData::qb_revenue_breakdown
monthly_sales <- CodeClanData::qb_monthly_sales
competitors <- CodeClanData::qb_competitors
device_data <- CodeClanData::qb_device_data

```


**Question 1.**  
Take the data in the dataset `qb_revenue_breakdown` and make a stacked bar chart showing the sources of revenue across the two years in the dataset.
<br>

**Answer 1**

```{r}

ggplot(revenue_breakdown) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = Product,
               y = Revenue,
               fill = Year),
               stat = "identity")
  

```


**Question 2.**  
Make a line chart showing monthly sales of the "flagship product" - the 'KwikBit Unit 1' - over the last year. This data is inside `qb_monthly_sales`, but you will need to use `filter()` or `subset()` (base `R)`.
<br>

**Answer 2**

```{r}

monthly_sales_unit_1 <- monthly_sales %>% 
  filter(Cashflow == "Kwikbit Unit 1 Sales")

ggplot(monthly_sales_unit_1) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Date,
               y = Amount,
               colour = Cashflow),
               stat = "identity")

```


**Question 3.**  
Make a line chart showing monthly revenue and costs over the last year. This data is also in `qb_monthly_sales`.								
<br>

**Answer 3**

```{r}

revenue_and_cost <- monthly_sales %>% 
  filter(Cashflow != "Kwikbit Unit 1 Sales")

ggplot(revenue_and_cost) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Date,
               y = Amount,
               group = Cashflow, # no need to group as specifying by colour
               colour = Cashflow)) +
  scale_y_continuous(               # to add y axis scale and ticks
    expand = c(0,0), # starting at 0
    limits = c(0, 3000), # limited at 3000
    breaks = seq(0, 3000, 250) # tick mark labels
  )

```


**Question 4.**  
Show annual sales of personal fitness trackers over the last 5 years broken down by company as a ribbon plot (use `geom_area`). This data is in `qb_competitors`.
<br>

**Answer 4**

```{r}

ggplot(competitors) +
  aes(x = Year,
      y = Revenue,
      colour = Company) +
  geom_area()


## class walk through

options(scipen = 10) # to remove scientific notation
competitors %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year,
             y = Revenue,
             fill = Company)) +
  geom_area() +
  theme_classic()

```


**Question 5.**  
Now show the sales from the four competitors as a line graph. Include an extra layer that shows the data points used to make the lines.
<br>

**Answer 5**

```{r}

ggplot(competitors) +
  aes(x = Year,
      y = Revenue,
      colour = Company) +
  geom_line(aes(group = Company)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5)

## class walk through

competitors %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year,
             y = Revenue,
             colour = Company)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()


```


**Question 6.**  
Now the company wants to compare the number of steps that their device counts vs. their competitors. Make a line graph of the number of steps throughout time, and use faceting to compare between companies and people. The data for this is in `qb_device_data`.
<br>

**Answer 6**


```{r}

ggplot(device_data) +
  geom_line(aes(x = hours,
                y = counts,
                group = device,
                colour = device)) +
  facet_wrap(~ device,
             ncol = 2)

## class walk through

device_data %>% 
  mutate(decimal_hour = hours + (mins/60)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = decimal_hour,
             y = counts)) +
  geom_line(aes(col = device)) +
  facet_wrap(device ~ id)


```


## Part 2 

**Question 1.**  
Take the plots that you produced in part one and now polish them by:

1. Adding appropriate labels
2. Changing the scales and coordinates when appropriate.
3. Applying a unified theme, which is described below:
  * Graphs should have white backgrounds, and use colour sparingly.
  * There should be faint grid lines.
  * Font sizes should be ~12pt although titles should be slightly larger and axis labels can be slightly smaller. 
  * All plots should use colours from the following company colour scheme.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("palette.JPG")
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
col_scheme <- c("#E89FE9", "#50434F", "#B6A7B5", "#F9A472", "#BD7040")
```

**Question 1.**  
Try out different ways of plotting these three datasets. Which graphs do you think are particularly effective at showing QikBit's success?
